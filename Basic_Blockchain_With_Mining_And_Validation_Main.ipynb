    "Here, we have added two new attributes:\n",
    "1. Hash target: Hash target is a hexadecimal value which forms the outer limit of a valid block hash in the proof-of-work method. Since lower target values will automatically start having zeros at the beginning, it is also explained as having a specific number of zeros at the beginning. Doing the search using hex number comparison will be faster generally than finding the number of zeros at the front using string manipulation, and it's more generic.\n",
    "2. Nonce: This is the attribute that a miner varies (generally starting from 0) to get an appropriate block hash.\n",
    "\n",
    "You'll also notice that instead of just calculating and assigning the default block hash, we are now running a mine_block method in the constructor. Normally, this would be called separately after creating a candidate block. We have added it as part of the constructor itself, just for succinctness.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the hash_block method, we have added both hash_target and nonce in the block hash generating string so that they are also unmodifiable later.\n",
    "\n",
    "The mine_block method keeps comparing the block hash with the hash_target (hex comparison) for this block. If it's not less than the target, it'll increase the nonce and try again. Once it hits a particular value which is lower than the hash, it'll exit and use that nonce to store the final block hash. The number of iterations, on average, depend on the hash target value. The lower the target, the longer it'll take. The block is now ready for publishing.\n",
